**Project Type:** Cybersecurity Audit / Security Awareness  
**Date:** Dec 22, 2025  
**Prepared by:** Emmanuel Olajoseph (Cybersecurity Analyst)  
**Organisation:** Confidential  

---

## Project Overview
This project evaluates employee vigilance against **credential-harvesting phishing attacks** following a phishing-awareness training program. A controlled phishing simulation was conducted to measure behavioral improvements in link-clicking, credential submission, and incident reporting.

---

## Objectives
- Reduce phishing link-click rates  
- Minimize credential submission attempts  
- Increase phishing incident reporting to the security team  

---

## Compliance Alignment
- **ISO/IEC 27001 – Annex A 6.3 (User Awareness & Training)**
- Supports internal **social-engineering risk management** objectives

---

## Tools Used
- **Zphisher:** Phishing site generation and interaction tracking  
- **Localxpose:** Optional internal port forwarding during testing  
- **Google Sheets:** KPI tracking and analysis  

---

## Simulation Scenario
Employees received a **crafted invoice-reminder email** requesting payment for WordPress services. The embedded link redirected users to a **replicated login portal** designed to simulate a credential-harvesting attack.

---

## Key Metrics (Before vs After Training)

| Metric | Baseline | Post-Campaign |
|------|---------|---------------|
| Link Clicks | 80% | 30% |
| Credential Submissions | 60% | 20% |
| Phishing Reports | 10% | 80% |

---

## Key Findings
- Significant reduction in phishing link interaction  
- Substantial drop in credential submission attempts  
- Strong increase in proactive phishing reporting  

---

## Recommendations
- Conduct **quarterly phishing simulations**
- Provide targeted refresher training for users who clicked or submitted credentials
- Display live phishing metrics on the security dashboard
- Introduce **gamified awareness programs** to reinforce reporting behavior

---

## Conclusion
The simulation demonstrated measurable improvements in employee security awareness and vigilance. The results support continued investment in user-focused security controls and align with ISO 27001 compliance and organizational risk-management goals.
